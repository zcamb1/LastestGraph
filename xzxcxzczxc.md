Price: At US $20 per month (US $16 if paid yearly), Pro removes every paywall the free tier hits in days; the small fee is offset by even a single hour of saved work.

Quota: Pro gives unlimited completions plus 500 priority (fast-queue) requests each month—any extra queries still run in the standard queue, so you’re never blocked.

Security: Pro (and Business) add Privacy Mode and admin controls that keep your code private, something the free Hobby plan lacks.

Bottom line: If you rely on AI daily, Pro is the smartest spend—no limits, faster answers, and enterprise-grade protection.
