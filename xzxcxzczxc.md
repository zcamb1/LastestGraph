Is it necessary to purchase a paid plan?
Short answer: Yes — to unlock Cursor AI’s full power, you need a paid plan.

Plan to start with right away
Plan	Why it’s the best “starter” choice
Pro (USD $20 / mo – or $16 / mo billed annually)	• Gives you the full desktop IDE experience, unlimited completions, 500 fast requests, and Max Mode access – everything you’ll evaluate in real work.
• Month-to-month billing lets you cancel any time if it doesn’t deliver ROI.

Two strongest reasons to go paid
No hard limits, no wait time – Unlimited completions plus 500 priority (fast) requests ensure the AI never “locks up” in the middle of your coding session.

Max Mode for serious projects – Only paid tiers let the AI read hundreds of thousands of tokens at once, essential for refactoring, debugging, or onboarding massive codebases.

Final takeaway: Skip the free tier’s caps; start with Pro so you immediately experience Cursor AI at its full, uninterrupted speed and depth.
